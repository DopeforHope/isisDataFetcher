# isisDataFetcher

Hello and welcome to the ISIS Data Fetcher Project.

[ISIS](https://isis.tu-berlin.de/) stands for Information System for Instructors and Student from the **TU Berlin**.
As far as I know ISIS bases on the Moodle and has a Shibboleth Login in front.

So the project is dedicated to all TU Students but everyone is invited to help. I can't provide a test account for you so if you want to use/test any code you have to have an ISIS account or the credentials from someone else.


## Idea
I want a programm which downloads all PDFs, ZIPs and so on from all your courses from the ISIS website.
